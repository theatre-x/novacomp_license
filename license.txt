----------
Preamble:
----------

The Nova Componere Public Works License is a copyleft license for creative works that works to obtain peace using four concepts:


Freedom
Justice
Equality
Kindness


The design and operation of the current creative works world prevents people from experiencing and creating works in an unbiased and safe place.
Many flaws plague this world and hold us back, not only as creators, but as civilized human beings.
Copying is NOT theft for it does not imply ownership of the original.
Art is one of the most important aspects of our species for it reflects the human conditions, beauty, opinion, and conditions and situations going on in the world around us.
Often, the sharing of works of art such as (But not limited to) music, movies, and written works through specific protocols (e.g. Bit-torrent and peer to peer) gets people condemned as “Thieves” or “Pirates”.
By condemning people as such damages the concept of good will in the eyes of many through the use of these propaganda terms.
This holds us back from achieving a better civilization for it corrupts trust and creates fear which makes the world operate on negativity rather than positivity.
A heavy bias dictates what is shown and created on a global scale.
This forces us artists and creators to either express ourselves truthfully or lie and hinder our self-expression to things that “Work” in the mainstream, corporate art world.
Choosing the latter, leads us down a road of biased, funneled creativity with heavily mainstreamed creations of redundancy, predictability, and lies.
Choosing the former, we follow a path that leads to emotional security and openness.
The Nova Componere project works to make the Nova Componere PWL compatible as possible with the following seven freedoms of Fropen Art:


0. The freedom to share art
1. The freedom to modify your own copy of someone else's art
2. The freedom to redistribute your modified version of an art, gratis or for a fee
3. The freedom to distribute an unmodified work of an art, gratis or for a fee
4. The freedom to blend arts
5. The freedom to study, document, and learn from art
6. The freedom to perform and publicly show art, for gratis or for a fee


“Fropen” (Free + Open) is an idea that combines Free, as in freedom, and Open as in open to all.
The name is meant to bring both Free Artists and Open Artists as one and no longer separate.
The Nova Componere project also works to maintain kindness with the Nova Componere Public Works License by allowing those who license their art under this license to have the option to redistribute art with or without a fee and give that same act of kindness to the next person.
Justice is supported by disallowing powerful entities like corporations from running down artists and drawing the spirit from them for their own gains.
Finally, equality is supported for the Nova Componere Public Art License allows anyone, no matter what their beliefs or physical appearance, to use the license and it's terms and conditions.
Though it seems contradicting to allow individuals and collectives to exercise the rights given within this text and not corporate entities, we must reminds ourselves that a corporation is NOT a human being.
The design of the Nova Componere Public Works License is meant to prevent others from denying you these freedoms.

As mentioned above, the Nova Componere Public Art License is copyleft.
