----------
Preamble:
----------

The Nova Componere Public Works License is a copy-left license for Creative Works that is designed to attempt to obtain peace using four concepts:


Freedom
Justice
Equality
Kindness


The design and operation of the current world prevents people from experiencing and creating works in an unbiased and safe place.
Many problems plague this world and hold us back, not only as creators, but as civilized human beings.
Copying is NOT theft for it is not seizure of ownership of the original work(s).
Artistry is one of the most important aspects of our species for it reflects the human conditions, beauty, opinion, and conditions and situations occurring, or that have occurred, in the world around us.
Often, the sharing of Creative Works such as (But not limited to) music, movies, and written works through specific protocols (e.g. Bit-torrent and peer to peer, even lending to friends) gets people condemned as “Thieves” or “Pirates”.
By condemning people as such damages the concept of good will in the eyes of many through the use of these propaganda terms.
These propaganda terms try to make the prosecutors seem to be in the right to the public which they are not.
A heavy bias dictates what is shown and created on a global scale.
This forces us creators to either express ourselves truthfully or lie and hinder their self-expression to things that “Work” in the mainstream, corporate world.
Choosing the latter, leads us down a road of biased, funneled creativity with heavily mainstreamed creations of redundancy, predictability, and lies.
Choosing the former, we follow a path that leads to emotional security and openness.
All of this holds us back from achieving a better civilization for it corrupts trust and creates fear which makes the world operate on negativity rather than positivity which is needed more than ever.

The Nova Componere project works to make the Nova Componere PWL compatible as possible with the following seven freedoms of Fropen Works:


0. The freedom to share creative works
1. The freedom to modify your own copy of someone else's work(s)
2. The freedom to redistribute your modified version of a creative work, gratis or for a fee
3. The freedom to distribute an unmodified work, gratis or for a fee
4. The freedom to blend creative works
5. The freedom to study, document, and learn from creative works
6. The freedom to perform and publicly show creative works, for gratis or for a fee


“Fropen” (Free + Open) is an idea that combines Free, as in freedom, and Open as in open to all.
The name is meant to bring both “Free” Creators and “Open” Creators as one and no longer separate.
The Nova Componere Project also works to maintain kindness with the Nova Componere Public Works License by allowing those who license their work(s) under this license to have the option to redistribute works with or without a fee and give that same act of kindness to the next person.
Justice is supported by disallowing powerful entities like corporations from running down creators and drawing the spirit from them for their own profit gains.
Finally, equality is supported because the Nova Componere Public Works License allows anyone, no matter what their configurations, to use the license and it's terms and conditions.
Though it seems contradicting to allow individuals and collectives to exercise the rights given within this text and not corporate entities, we must remind ourselves that a corporation is NOT a human being.
The design of the Nova Componere Public Works License is meant to prevent others from denying you these freedoms and core concepts of peace.

As mentioned above, the Nova Componere Public Works License is copy-left.
This means that when a derivative of a work under the Nova Componere PWL is shared and/or modified, the rights stated in this document MUST be passed along to the recipients without any form of modification to these rights what so ever.
